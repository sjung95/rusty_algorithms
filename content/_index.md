**This blog is dedicated to those who are just a *tad* bit rusty in algorithms.**

**Code *fearlessly*. Try out things you don't understand. Have things break and then fix them.**

## Contents of the blog

Rusty Algorithms publishes content following two concurrent threads that run in parallel.

### Thread 1: Algorithms and Data Structures

This blog hosts solutions to algorithm and data structure questions in Python, Go, and Rust.

The timeline is as follows:

- [ ] Core Algorithms Question
  - [Yangshun Tay's Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/algorithms/algorithms-introduction)
  - [Blind's Top 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)
- [ ] Most popular LeetCode questions

### Thread 2: Systems

This blog hosts system programming reviews.

The timeline is as follows:

- [ ] [Philipp Oppermann's OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
- [ ] [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
- [ ] [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/)
- [ ] [Design Patterns in Python](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/python)
- [ ] [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)
- [ ] A review and comparison of parallelism between Go and Rust (green threads vs system threads)

## About

This is my blog, *Rusty Algorithms*, by Raymond Sheng. I'm a strong believer of applying composition and the writing process to coding. **Write often.** ***Rewrite even more.*** [Check out this course on composition by ASU and Crash Course.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNrrxHpJhC8mNXjrAL3Ey1Q6iI35cymzl)

This blog was made with Rust and [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), using the [docs as code theme](https://github.com/codeandmedia/zola_docsascode_theme).
